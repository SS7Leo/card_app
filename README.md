   - **Animations**: Integrated subtle animations using Tailwind's built-in utilities.  

2. **Backend**:  
   - Developed RESTful APIs in Node.js to handle CRUD operations for card data.  
   - Used Express.js to define routes and middleware for API requests.  

3. **Testing**:  
   - Ensured data validation on forms.  
   - Verified API endpoints for correct data exchange.
